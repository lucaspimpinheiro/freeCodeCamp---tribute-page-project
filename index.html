            provinces, enthusiasticaly received by his people
          </li>

            <strong>1848</strong> - While the Emperor confronted the trade of
            illegally imported slaves, Praieira revolt erupted in Northeastern
            Brazil, suppressed only a year later
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1850</strong> - The Eusebio de Queiros Law was promulgated,
            which gave the Brazilian Empire broad authority to combat illegal
            slave trade.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1852</strong> - The Emperor has forged an alliance between
            Brazil, Uruguay and disaffected Argentines, leading to the Platine
            war, and subsequent overthrown of the Argentine dictator and
            stabilization of the region
          </li>

            north of the capital, visiting Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe,
            Alagoas, Pernambuco and Paraíba. The trip was a huge success, with
            the Emperor welcomed everywhere with warmth and joy
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1862</strong> - British consul in Rio nearly sparkled a war,
            as he sent an ultimatum containing abusive demands out of a minor
            incident, the arrest of drunken British officers who were causing a
            disturbance in the streets of Rio. The Emperor refused to yield.
            Even after the consul issued orders for British warships to capture
            Brazilian merchan vessels as indemnity. The consul then proposed a
            peaceful settlement through international arbitration. The Brazilian
            government presented its demands and, upon seeing the British
            government's position weaken, severed diplomatic ties with Britain
          </li>

            invaded Brazil and Argentina, triggering the Paraguayan War. Pedro
            II decides to go to the front in person. Pedro II's coordination of
            the military operations and his personal example played a decisive
            role in successfully repulsing the Paraguayan invasion of Brazilian
            territory. Before returning to Rio de Janeiro, he received the
            British diplomatic envoy Edward Thornton, who apologized on behalf
            of Queen Victoria and the British Government for the crisis between
            the empires. The Emperor regarded this diplomatic victory over the
            most powerful nation of the world as sufficient and renewed friendly
            relations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1870</strong> - The Paraguayan war ends with a Brazilian
            victory
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1871</strong> - few Brazilians opposed slavery and even
            fewer openly condemned it. Pedro II, who did not own slaves, was one
            of the few who did oppose slavery. He consciously ignored the
            growing political damage to his image and to the monarchy in
            consequence of his support for abolition. in 1871, was enacted the
            Law of Free Birth, under which all children born to slave women
            after that date were considered free-born.
          </li>

            Austria, Italy, Egypt, Greece, Switzerland and France. In Coburg he
            visited his daughter's tomb. He traveled under the assumed name "Dom
            Pedro de Alcântara", insisting upon being treated informally and
            staying only in hotels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1889</strong> - Although there was no desire in Brazil among
            the majority of the population to change the form of government, the
            military launched a coup d'état, overthrowing the monarchy. Pedro II
            dismissed all suggestions for quelling the rebellion that
            politicians and military leaders put forward to avoid a civil war
            that would only bring suffering to his people. So he and his family
            were sent into exile in Europe
